# Portfolio-Project

This portfolio project was the final assessment for the 6th course in the "Introduction to Front-End Development" Certification. I learned to implement many React features/concepts. This includes working with multiple components, utilizing hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useContext`) and making my own hook (`useSubmit`).

Additionally, I got the chance with work with some cool libraries such as Chakra UI, Formik and Yup. Chakra UI was used for the whole UI for this project and Formik and Yup were used in unison for the form validation in the "Contact Me" section.
